# REST_API_Postman_Java

REST PROJECT
The aim of the REST project is to provide a group of people (community) with a web page that
would allow them to post a set of media items they own such as: books, video games, DVDs,
etc. The idea is that the owner could post comments on its items and so do the other users of
the website. This could be used as a recommendation page. People before buying or reading a
book for instance, would first read the comments and why not ask if the user could land it to
them or sell it. Letâ€™s focus on the following scenarios:
1-users can get access to the page (free access) and for instance ask to display/list media by
- Categories (books, video games, DVDs)
- By searching a given keyword
- Or by city
- By user

2- Once the list of items displayed, one can click on one item to see more details about it
(authors, year, etc) and the rates that other users gave it
3- users can post their own items on the website so others can ask to borrow them or simply to
put recommendations on them
4- A user can delete only its own items.
Work to be delivered:
-Implementation of the above-cited functionalities using REST Web Services. The
implementation would come as a server side application in Java only (with a data base or simply
objects in collections in memory).
For the client side three options
- Easy: use of Postman plugin in chrome or SOAPUI to simulate REST WS Calls
- Medium: implementation of Java main class with the WS calls hard coded
- Hard: a full web front end using HTML and Javascript
Mandatory: use of Jax-RS spec with the Jersey implementation. Do not use Spring framework.
For the defense: no ppt, no docs, only a working code! 15min max by Group. Max 4 people by
group. Only Java, no other languages are allowed.
